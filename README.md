# hello-world

I am an expert data science engineer, able to get clear insights from complex data, coming from all sources.
First, let's talk about my curriculum : I am engineer in agronomics graduate of AgroParisTech in 2007. That is to say, I have an universal curriculum, with course in agronomics naturally, but also Mathematics and statistics, physics and IT subjects such as algorithmic,  data analysis, data management.
For more than 10 years, I have been working on multiples studies and projects at Agrosolutions, french leader engineering agency in agro-environment in Paris. I have managed projects and people in order to carry out studies about data collection, data treatment, model construction of agricultural phenomena, statistical analysis, looking for the best results for the clientâ€™s needs.
After being the team manager of 7 people involved in data treatment and analysis, I have had a position of Data Scientist Senior Consultant, expert on farming data valuation. Now I'm senior consultant for CGI, looking for new challenges.
Working with different kind of data (such as pedological situation, climate, farming practices, environnemental impact), I am able to organise the work of interdisciplinary teams (developers, data  managers, statisticians, agronomists, sales agents, researchers) to provide to the clients reliable and understandable results. And working for different customers (farmers' cooperatives, insurance companies, food industry, french ministry of agriculture), I am able to switch from one subject to another and to learn fast new areas and new processes.
With a curious mind, I like to provide explanations on complex phenomena or tendencies.
